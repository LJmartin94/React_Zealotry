Different languages have different grammatical systems (and pre/suffixes) for ordinal numbers.
As part of the localiser should have some language specific logic to change 1 into 1st, 2 into 2nd etc. for English,
and other solutions for other languages.

e.g. 
English: firST secoND thiRD fourTH fifTH... twenty-firST (but not elevenST) twenty-second (but not twelfND)
1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th .. 11th 12th.. 21st 22nd

For an idea of different systems implemented by different languages.
